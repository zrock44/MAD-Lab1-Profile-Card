# Mobile Application Development Lab #1 - Profile Card App
This application is simple. The only thing it does is display a circular picture of my cat with my name below it and a short bio below that, all of it in front of a cyan background.

# Installation
To run this application:
1. Clone this repository to a folder on your PC
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Select a virtual android device or your physical android device from the drop-down list at the top of the window
4. Click the green play button to the right of the device drop-down list and it should run after a minute or two
